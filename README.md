## How to setup/activate the Python virtual environment
   - TO SETUP:

     In the ./CeneoWebScraper directory:
     ```
     python -m venv {directory name, e.g. ".venv"}
     ```

   - TO ACTIVATE:

     In the ./CeneoWebScraper directory:
     ```
     source .venv/Scripts/activate
     ```

     You know it works when after every command you enter in the terminal "(.venv)" is printed in the next line.

     Ensure that the virtual environment is active, then
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
